===============================

Very good sample application for getting recent media by tag name using Instagram API. This project gives you lot of ideas for implementing getting recent media by tag name. It has built using Bootstrap, JQuery libraries. 

Instagram API https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/snow/media/recent?client_id=xxxxxxx gives you list of all recent media tagged by 'snow'.

Note: If you run this sample app(index.html) directly from file system without hosting into server and if you use Chrome browser as test browser, you need to run chrome with disable security option from console. 
i.e. C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application>chrome.exe --disable-web-security.
